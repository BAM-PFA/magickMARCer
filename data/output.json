Portions of the severe upper 1/3rd tear/skew is caused by the severe over exposure, sort of a voltage overload when recording, example, how severe the tear is around 7:00 and it instantly clears around 7:30 when the camera pans right off the window into the darker room. The same sections are very washed out and Y values clip. The interview in the room, close up, window light source from the left, the left side of his face is recorded severely over exposed at that portion. TBC video level adjusted as low as it will go brings it below clip level on a scope but still over exposed. 17:15 is another example of recorded severely over exposed and cause tearing upper 1/3rd of the picture.
